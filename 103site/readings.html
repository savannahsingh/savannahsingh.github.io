          <h3> Reading 1 </h3>
      <p>    A system is composed of groups that each have a purpose to make all of the groups work together to form a whole. A system is not a single piece working on its own, it has to have multiple parts working together.
Modularity is creating individual pieces and placing them together to create multiple systems, they are interchangeable and replaceable. Decomposability means when the individual parts of a system cannot be broken down any further. Emergence is when components of a system do things together that they would not be able to do on their own. Chaos Theory is a complex system that is very susceptible to change and minor changes can lead to severe consequences.
Tessellation is a mosaic pattern that draws in the viewers of the piece. I have seen tessellation patterns in clothing and other decorative objects such as curtains and rugs. Pineapples
The difference is that modularity does not all have to have the same shape as the tessellations do. Modularity systems can be simpler.
The difference is whether or not it is creating a pattern. If the artpiece is creating a repetitive pattern it is uniform or periodic, but then it is not following any pattern it is complexity or aperiodic.

<h3>Reading 2</h3>
<p>  The similarities between Walter de Maria and Banksy works are how much meaning is behind both of their
  works. Banksy seems to want to shock his audience more than de Maria and his pieces seem more to the
  point than de Maria's. De Maria's work feels more abstract.
  All sign art is site specific. They have to relate to their location in some way. Sign art often
  looks similar to signs we regularly see such as traffic signs. A land art piece that was made in response
  to its location is <i>Spiral Jetty</i> by Robert Smithson. He created it to reconnect with the environment and
  the counterclockwise shape of the spiral suggests infinty.

<h3>Reading 3</h3>
<p>We no longer see dinosaurs the way we once did. Now we realize that dinosaurs were not as reptile like
  as we imagined. They were likely larger in size and had feathers. We have always portrayed them as giant
  reptiles in movies and books. This affects our understanding because we have always believed they looked
  a specific way and they may have been completely different. John Conway's dinosaurs are much more interesting
  and imaginative compared to the way we have expected dinosaurs to have looked. He tried to change their
  shape and add fat where it might have been, he wanted to show that dinosaurs probably looked a lot weirder.
  Material specuation is when we take an object and give it a meaning that makes sense to us but is not what
  the object was intended to be or used for. This technique could be used to create objects that refer to the
  past or present by creating an object that is not possible and giving it a place and purpose in that setting.
