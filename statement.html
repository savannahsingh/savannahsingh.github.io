<br>
  <p>My art is about telling a story. </p>
  <p>I have been inspired by games, cartoons, and comics as a child. Those stories stuck with me as I grew up and became the reason I chose to pursue a career in art. I aim to create a variety of art that can reach out to wider audiences. My stories range from playful to serious and everything in between. </p>
    <p>The story is sometimes serious. I am very passionate about the environment and often incorporate how humanity is affecting the planet into my pieces. I strive to create art that can be interpreted in more than one way; I believe my environmental videos accomplish that.</p>
    <p>Other times, the story is more playful. I wanted to create something similar to games I experienced as a child. Which led me to create 'choose your own adventure' games. I wanted to create something fun and simple that anyone can play.  </p>
