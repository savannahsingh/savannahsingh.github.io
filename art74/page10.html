<h1><align= "center">Oh no!</h1>
<p><align= "center">According to the volunteer, your pet has already been euthanized!</p>
<p><align= "center">This is the unfortunate reality of Peta. Majority of the animals that come into Peta's custody get euthanized. In 2014, the percentage of animals euthanized were 81%! In prior years, this number was as high as 90%. Peta doesn't just euthanize sick or dying animals. Their kill shelters euthanize mostly healthy animals that would have a good chance at finding a home.</p>
