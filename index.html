    <h3>"Excuses", Digital Video, 2018</h3>
    <p>This video is about global warming and how people act towards it. Humanity often displaces the blame and rarely takes responsibility for their own actions. While majority of global warming is caused by major companies polluting the
      environment, it doesn't mean we can't do little things in our everyday life to make the world a cleaner place. When it comes time to "pay" it would be easier on everyone to split the responsibility, the same way a group of friends might split
      a check. </p>

      <h3>"Choices", Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>This video is about the environment and how much damage humanity has caused. It is a side by side comparison of what the earth was before and what's happened in more recent years. It depicts a variety of environmental concerns, such as
        global warming, deforestation, and pollution. People often overlook these things and act like it isn't actually happening because they can't see it. This video is meant to show that these disasters are real and continue to get worse every
        single day. There is still time to change the outcome but people need to choose to come together to save the environment. </p>
