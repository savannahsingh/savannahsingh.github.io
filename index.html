 <h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:century gothic;">"Excuses", Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p style= "text-align:center; font-family:century gothic;">This video is about global warming and how people act towards it. Humanity often displaces the blame and rarely takes responsibility for their own actions. While majority of global warming is caused by major companies polluting the environment, it doesn't mean we can't do little things in our everyday life to make the world a cleaner place. When it comes time to "pay" it would be easier on everyone to split the responsibility, the same way a group of friends might split a check. </p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:century gothic;">"Choices", Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p style= "text-align:center; font-family:century gothic;">This video is about the environment and how much damage humanity has caused. It is a side by side comparison of what the earth was before and what's happened in more recent years. It depicts a variety of environmental concerns, such as global warming, deforestation, and pollution. People often overlook these things and act like it isn't actually happening because they can't see it. This video is meant to show that these disasters are real and continue to get worse every single day. There is still time to change the outcome but people need to choose to come together to save the environment. </p>
