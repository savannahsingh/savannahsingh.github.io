  <h3 style="text-align:center; font-family:century gothic;">"Choices", Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p style= "text-align:center; font-family:century gothic;">This video is about the environment and how much damage humanity has caused. It is a side by side comparison of what the earth was before and what's happened in more recent years. It depicts a variety of environmental concerns, such as global warming, deforestation, and pollution. People often overlook these things and act like it isn't actually happening because they can't see it. This video is meant to show that these disasters are real and continue to get worse every single day. There is still time to change the outcome but people need to choose to come together to save the environment. </p>
