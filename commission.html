   <p>❖ All payments should be made through invoice method. I will invoice you. DO NOT send me any payment, it will be refunded.</p>
   <p>❖ Payment is due in full upon completion of sketch for full color commissions.
      You will receive a low resolution sketch for reviews - any major changes must be made at this stage -
      You will also receive a low resolution image at base color stage to make sure all the colors are correct, and will receive the full resolution after completion.</p>
  <p> ❖ Payment is required within three days of your commission sketch. Payment is required upon invoice for sketch commissions. You will not receive your sketch commission until payment is completed.
      Failure to pay will result in your request being dropped. If you need more time, please let me know.</p>
  <p> ❖ I do not accept refunds, all of my recent work is posted on Instagram so you can see from there if I am capable of completing your request. If you do not believe I can complete your request, I suggest finding another artist. All works will be completed in my current style, I will not replicate another artist’s style.</p>

   <p style="font-size:130%">❖ARTIST❖</p>
  <p> By commissioning me, you’re purchasing my artist labor only. I retain all copyrights over my work, which include but are not limited to the right to reproduce or use the image as a sample for self-promotion, unless otherwise agreed upon.</p>

   <p>❖ I will respect your request to not publicly post your commission. No explanation necessary but if you post the image anywhere, I ask that you credit me and link back to my instagram.</p>
   <p>❖ I cannot claim the Intellectual Property or reuse/resell the image for personal and commercial projects. Unless agreed upon.</p>
   <p>❖ I reserve the right to reject your commission proposal without question. This includes if you did not follow the rules for said order.</p>
   <p>❖ I reserve the right to modify and resell any rejected sketches as "pre-posed" at a later date.</p>

   <p style="font-size:130%">❖COMMISSIONER❖</p>
   <p>The commissioner may upload the work done for you to your site as long as it is credited and linked back to my Instagram. Once a piece is commissioned, you may use it for any personal use that you please, including but not limited to icons, signatures, layouts, wallpapers, themes and personal site display.</p>

   <p>❖ You may not claim the work to be your own, edit or set it up for redistribution. You may not use it for any external projects, commercial or non-commercial unless agreed upon.</p>
   <p>❖ You may NOT resell it.</p>

   <p>If you are not sure whether your request counts as personal, feel free to ask me about its intended use.</p>

  <p style="font-size:130%"> ❖PROCEDURE❖</p>
   <p>Preface. You understand that I am not working with only your priorities in mind. I will work on multiple projects at once and I am a full time student so I can anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks to complete your commission.</p>

   <p>❖ After payment is received: I sketch, color, and paint depending on your commission type.</p>
   <p>❖ I do not accept "description only" commissions. You must have at least one visual reference, this can be actual photos, images of your character, or pose references, etc.</p>
   <p>❖ Sketch commissions do not have an approval stage. You may request minor tweaks if I missed any distinguishing features present in your reference.</p>
   <p>❖ For larger, full color commissions, one large edits are allowed during the sketch phase. I reserve the right to add a $3 USD fee over any edits after the first stage.</p>
   <p>❖ Please be clear and concise in your description of the change. You can use other works and photos you like as references for the changes!</p>
   <p>❖ I will always send a low resolution base color image to fix any color errors of your character! Please, let me know if I have made any mistakes. Anything that needs to be fixed on my mistake, as it was on your reference(s) and I missed it, will always be fixed for free.</p>
   <p>❖ A full size, no watermark image will be given. It is necessary that you use a watermark/resized version of the image before sharing publicly.</p>
