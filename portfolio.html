        <p>My art is about telling a story.</p>
        <p>I have been inspired by games, cartoons, and comics as a child. Those stories stuck with me as I grew up and became the reason I chose to pursue a career in art. I aim to create a variety of art that can reach out to wider audiences,
          including children. I take a playful approach to serious topics.</p>
        <p>I am very passionate about the environment and often incorporate how humanity is affecting the planet into my pieces. I strive to create art that can be interpreted in more than one way; I believe my environmental works accomplish that.
          Even when I am not creating environmental works, I strive to create work about sustainability and resilience.</p>

        <p>A recent study has shown that 100% of sea turtles in the ocean have plastics or mircoplastics in their bodies. The study examined every species of sea turtle from all over the world.
          This illustration is based off this statistic. The plants and other sea creatures are substituted by plastics and other pollution that is commonly found in our oceans to show how easy it is for turtles and other animals to confuse the
          plastic in the oceans with the food they normally eat.</p>

        <p>Made in Premiere Pro</p>
        <p>This video is about the environment and how much damage humanity has caused. It is a side by side comparison of what the earth was before and what's happened in more recent years. It depicts a variety of environmental concerns, such as
          global warming, deforestation, and pollution.Â People often overlook these things and act like it isn't actually happening because they can't see it. This video is meant to show that these disasters are real and continue to get worse every
          single day. There is still time to change the outcome but people need to choose to come together to save the environment.</p>

        <p>Pictures that are shared on the internet are often edited to be more appealing to its viewers and this changes people's perceptions of these places or things that are being portrayed. They can make places more interesting and a lot of
          travel websites take advantage of this to persuade people to visit to these places. I chose a picture of nature specifically because I find nature beautiful without any editing or filter yet people continue to alter images of natural
          places. </p>

        <p>Pokemon has been a world wide phenomenon for over 2 decades, and it is the mascot is one of the most recognizable video games in the industry. I chose Pikachu because it is one of my favorite of all the hundreds of Pokemon. Pokemon has
          been apart of many of our lives growing up and has had an influence on us. </p>

        <p>Digital Video, 2min, 2018</p>
        <p>Made in Premiere Pro</p>
        <p>This video is about global warming and how people act towards it. Humanity often displaces the blame and rarely takes responsibility for their own actions. While majority of global warming is caused by major companies polluting the
          environment, it doesn't mean we can't do little things in our everyday life to make the world a cleaner place. When it comes time to "pay" it would be easier on everyone to split the responsibility, the same way a group of friends might
          split
          a check.</p>

        <p> Many animals end up in shelters all over the world. Sometimes they are pets that have ran off and other times, they are stray animals. In my net art project, we will be following 4 different pets. We will see what happens to them after
          they are captured and placed in one of Peta's shelters.</p>
